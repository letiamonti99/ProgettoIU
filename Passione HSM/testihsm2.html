                                I gotta say what's on my mind</br>
Something about us</br>
doesn't seem right these days</br>
life keeps getting in the way</br>
Whenever we try somehow the plan</br>
is always rearranged</br>
It's so hard to say</br>
But I've gotta do what's best for me</br>
You'll be ok...</br>
I've got to move on and be who I am</br>
I just don't belong here</br>
I hope you understand</br>
We might find our place</br>
in this world someday</br>
But at least for now</br>
I gotta go my own way</br>
Don't wanna leave it all behind</br>
But I get my hopes up</br>
and I watch them fall everytime</br>
Another colour turns to grey</br>
and it's just too hard to watch it all</br>
slowly fade away</br>
I'm leaving today 'cause I've</br>
gotta do what's best for me</br>
you'll be ok...</br>
I've got to move on and be who I am</br>
I just don't belong here</br>
I hope you understand</br>
We might find our place in this</br>
world someday</br>
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way</br>
What about us?</br>
What about everything we've been through?</br>
What about trust?</br>
you know I never wanted to hurt you</br>
and what about me?</br>
What am I supposed to do?</br>
I gotta leave but I'll miss you</br>
I'll miss you</br>
So I've got to move on and be who I am</br>
Why do you have to go?</br>
I just don't belong here</br>
I hope you understand</br>
I'm trying to understand</br>
We might find our place in this</br>
world someday</br>
but at least for now</br>
I want you to stay</br>
I wanna go my own way
I've got to move on and be who I am</br>
What about us?</br>
I just don't belong here</br>
I hope you understand</br>
I'm trying to understand</br>
We might find our place in this</br>
world someday</br>
but at least for now</br>
I gotta go my own way</br>
I gotta go my own way</br>
I gotta go my own way</br>

                            I wanna listen to my own heart talking</br>
                            I need to count on myself instead</br>
                            Did you ever?</br>
                            Loose yourself to get what you want</br>

                            How will I know if there's a path worth taking?</br>
                            Should I question every move I make?</br>
                            With all I've lost my heart is breaking</br>
                            I don't wanna make the same mistake</br>
                            Did you ever?</br>
                            Doubt your dream will ever come true</br>

                            Out on my own, it's such a scary place</br>
                            The answers are all inside of me</br>
                            All I gotta do is believe</br>
