                You can bet there's nothing but net</br>
                When I am in a zone and on a roll</br>
                But I've got a confession, my own secret obsession</br>
                And it's making me lose control</br>
                Everybody gather 'round</br>
                Well if Troy can tell his secret then I can tell mine... I bake</br>
                What?</br>
                I love to bake! Strudels, scones, even apple pan dowdy!</br>
                Not another sound</br>
                Someday I hope to make the perfect crême brûlée!</br>

                Don't mess with the flow, no no</br>
                Stick to the status quo</br>
                Look at me and what do you see</br>
                Intelligence beyond compare</br>
                But inside I am stirring, something strange is occurring</br>
                It's a secret I need to share</br>
                Open up, dig way down deep</br>
                Hip hop is my passion! I love to pop and lock and jam and break!</br>
                Is that even legal?</br>
                Not another peep</br>
                It's just dancing. Sometimes I think it's cooler than homework</br>
                No, no, no, nooooooooooo</br>
                No, no, no</br>
                Stick to the stuff you know</br>

                Stick to the status quo</br>
                Listen well, I'm ready to tell</br>
                About a need that I cannot deny</br>
                Dude, there's no explanation for this awesome sensation</br>
                But I'm ready to let it fly</br>
                Speak your mind and you'll be heard</br>
                Alright, if Troy wants to be a singer, then I'm coming clean! I play the cello!</br>
                Awesome! What is it?</br>
                A saw?</br>
                No, dude, it's like a giant violin!</br>

                    It's funny when you find yourself Looking from the outside</br>
                    I'm standing here but all I want</br>
                    Is to be over there</br>
                    Why did I let myself believe</br>
                    Miracles could happen</br>
                    Cause now I have to pretend That I don't really care</br>
                    I thought you were my fairytale</br>
                    A dream when I'm not sleeping</br>
                    A wish upon a star</br>
                    That's coming true</br>
                    But everybody else could tell</br>
                    That I confused my feelings with the truth</br>
                    When there was me and you</br>
                    I swore I knew the melody</br>
                    That I heard you singing</br>
                    And when you smiled You made me feel</br>
                    Like I could sing along</br>
                    But then you went and changed the words</br>
                    Now my heart is empty</br>
                    I'm only left with used-to-be's</br>
                    And once upon a song</br>
                    Now I know you're not a fairytale</br>
                    And dreams were meant for sleeping</br>
                    And wishes on a star </br>
                    Just don't come true</br>
                    Cause now even I can tell That I confused my feelings with the truth</br>
                    Because I liked the view</br>
                    When there was me and you</br>
                    I can't believe that</br>
                    I could be so blind</br>
                    It's like you were floating</br>
                    While I was falling</br>
                    And I didn't mind</br>
                    Because I liked the view</br>
                    Thought you felt it too</br>
